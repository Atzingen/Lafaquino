Lafaquino
=========

This is an Arduino board [1] with only one copper layer
and USB connection. The board is designed to be a "make it
your self" board that cam be done with simple soldering and 
the copper board printed sheet.

It was inspired on the Arduino Severino Board [2], that was an easy to
make arduino board, but had only RS232 Serial Connection and no USB.

The Lafaquino Board maintain the same pins layout for shields compatibility, having a
single copper layer and usb connection

Developed in the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) [3], in the Laboratory of Applied Computational Physics (LAFAC) [4]

WARNING1: The board has no 3.3V pin, so do not use shields that require this Voltage

WARNING2; Do not use both USB cable and Power Supply at the same time
